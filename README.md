Welcome to Upside!

## Upside in the budgeting world refers to the predicted appreciation in the value of an investment.

The goal of this application is to help the user with their budgeting goals. Often, when someone
looks at their bank accounts, they don't see that some of the money that is in their account
is needed for expenses and might feel like they have more money than they do. This application
aims to take all of your accounts (Bank Accounts and Credit Cards) along with projected expenses
and income to calculate how much disposable income you have available at any time!

# Application Features

1. User will be able to add and configure their Bank Accounts and Credit Cards. This will tell the
   application the balance of each account when it is added to your profile.
2. User will be able to add Expense and Revenue items that can be either a one time item or a
   recurring item. This will help the application determine what your cash flow is for the  
   period.
3. Once all your accounts and expenses/revenues have been entered, the application home page will show
   you a summary of your data. You will see how much total cash you have, what your expected expenses
   are for the period, and what your disposable income is after all expenses are considered.

# Future Enhancements

1. Version 2.0 will then allow you to take you disposable income and allocate it to future expenses
   (such as future car purchase or emergency fund). The app will then remove the amount from disposable
   income.
